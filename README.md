# ESRD_XWAS

End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Sex differences were observed with male subjects in a higher risk for progression to ESRD compared to females. Due to the differential genetic makeup between males and females, sex-specific genetic effects are more likely to be identified on the X chromosome. However, the sex chromosomes were excluded in most of the genome-wide association studies. For this purpose, we studied the associations of over 120,000 X chromosome variants with ESRD in almost 2750 Chinese individuals, and further identified three new genomic regions associated with ESRD.
